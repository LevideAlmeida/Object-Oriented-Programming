The Great Navigations were a series of maritime expeditions carried out by
Europeans between the 15th and 16th centuries, aimed at exploring new trade
routes to the East and expanding the territorial borders of European countries.

The main nations that participated in the Great Navigations were Portugal,
Spain, France, England and the Netherlands. The expeditions were led by
navigators such as Vasco da Gama, Christopher Columbus, Bartolomeu Dias,
Ferdinand Magellan, among others.

Among the main consequences of the Great Navigations, we can highlight the
establishment of the spice trade between Europe and Asia, the expansion of the
Portuguese and Spanish empires to the Americas and Africa, and the beginning of
the process of economic and cultural globalization. However, the Great
Navigations also had negative impacts, such as the exploitation and enslavement
of indigenous and African peoples, the genocide of various cultures, and the
destruction of entire ecosystems.
